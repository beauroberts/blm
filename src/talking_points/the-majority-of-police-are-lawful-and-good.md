  When people say "there are no good cops," it doesn't mean that all cops are
  bad people with bad motives. But at best, the "good" cops are silent and
  complicit in a system that allows the bad cops to continue getting away with
  violence, discrimination, and corruption (often because they, too, suffer
  consequences for raising issues—this is known as the Blue Wall of Silence).

  Additionally, it’s not as simple as separating good cops and bad cops. For instance, some of the police who kneeled in support with protesters were also the ones who tear-gassed or arrested them later in the evening.


  Arguing that the problem is with individual cops distracts from the systemic change needed to allow good cops to be successful. In the U.S., the entire incentive structure for policing is complex and flawed—we shouldn't focus on reforming individual cops, but rather, fixing the entire system.

  当人们说"没有好警察"时，这并不意味着所有的警察都是动机不好的坏人。但充其量，“好”警察是沉默的，在一个允许坏警察继续逃避暴力出警的惩罚、歧视和腐败的系统中，他们是同谋。（因为通常如果他们提出了不同意见，他们会遭受严重后果
  – 所以被称为[沉默的蓝墙](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_wall_of_silence))。


  此外，也不是把好警察和坏警察分开那么简单。例如，一些跪下支持抗议者的警察也是在晚上晚些时候用催泪瓦斯驱散或逮捕他们的人。


  无可争辩的是，问题出在只把注意力集中到个别警察上，而没有关注让好警察取得成功所需的系统性变革。在美国，整个警务激励结构是复杂和有缺陷的——我们不应该专注于改变个别警察，而应该专注于修复整个系统。

ask_yourself: Doctors and lawyers in America need licenses and malpractice
  insurance—who should be held responsible when police cause harm? When cops and
  their supervisors turn a blind eye to bad behaviors, who polices their
  behavior?
