title: The majority of police are lawful and good.
title_zh: "[]"
rebuttal: >-
  When people say "there are no good cops," it doesn't mean that all cops are
  bad people with bad motives. But at best, the "good" cops are silent and
  complicit in a system that allows the bad cops to continue getting away with
  violence, discrimination, and corruption (often because they, too, suffer
  consequences for raising issues—this is known as the Blue Wall of Silence).

  Additionally, it’s not as simple as separating good cops and bad cops. For instance, some of the police who kneeled in support with protesters were also the ones who tear-gassed or arrested them later in the evening.


  Arguing that the problem is with individual cops distracts from the systemic change needed to allow good cops to be successful. In the U.S., the entire incentive structure for policing is complex and flawed—we shouldn't focus on reforming individual cops, but rather, fixing the entire system.


  ## Ask Yourself


  Doctors and lawyers in America need licenses and malpractice insurance—who should be held responsible when police cause harm? When cops and their supervisors turn a blind eye to bad behaviors, who polices their behavior?
