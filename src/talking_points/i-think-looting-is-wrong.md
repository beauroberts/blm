title: I think looting is wrong.

  First, we have to acknowledge that any time large groups of angry people
  gather spontaneously, property damage is common. During the BLM protests, a
  small percentage of those protesting are actually looting. But there are many
  reasons that it happens.


  In protest, acts of vandalism happen on symbolic grounds (e.g. large corporations like Target, police stations, statues). In the U.S., these acts represent a desire for a redistribution of property—it’s a form of empowerment. It has been a way make one’s voice heard when peaceful protests go frustratingly unheard. And, some looters just aren’t affiliated with the protests at all, and are taking advantage of the situation. Others are acting in response to media attention.


  Looting happens partly because of protests, and protests happen because of more systemic issues in society. To stop people from looting, we have to examine the root causes and create systemic change. Kimberly Jones explains this in [How Can We Win.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb9_qGOa9Go)

  As Christian Davenport, a political-science professor at the University of Michigan, put it to me, “the best way to prevent looting is to provide individuals with a living wage, provide for their basic needs, treat them with human dignity, and facilitate a life that is about thriving.”
