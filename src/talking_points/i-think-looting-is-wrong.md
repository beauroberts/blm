title: I think looting is wrong.

  Response: First, we have to acknowledge that any time large groups of angry
  people gather spontaneously, property damage is common. During the BLM
  protests, a small percentage of those protesting were actually looting. But
  there are many reasons that it happens.


  In protest, acts of vandalism happen on symbolic grounds (e.g. large corporations like Target, police stations, statues). In the U.S., these acts in these locations represent a desire for a redistribution of property—it’s a form of empowerment. It has been a way to make one’s voice heard when peaceful protests go frustratingly unheard. And indeed, some looters aren’t affiliated with the protests at all, and are taking advantage of the situation. Others are acting in response to media attention.


  Looting happens partly because of protests, and protests happen because of more systemic issues in society. To stop people from looting, we have to examine the root causes and create systemic change. In *The Atlantic*, one political science professor sums it up: “the best way to prevent looting is to provide individuals with a living wage, provide for their basic needs, treat them with human dignity, and facilitate a life that is about thriving.”\[1] Kimberly Jones also explains this impassionately in [How Can We Win.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb9_qGOa9Go)
