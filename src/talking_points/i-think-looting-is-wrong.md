  First, we have to acknowledge that any time large groups of angry people
  gather spontaneously, property damage is common. During the BLM protests, a
  small percentage of those protesting were actually looting. But there are many
  reasons that it happens.


  In protest, acts of vandalism happen on symbolic grounds (e.g. large corporations like Target, police stations, statues). In the U.S., these acts in these locations represent a desire for a redistribution of property—it’s a form of empowerment. It has been a way to make one’s voice heard when peaceful protests go frustratingly unheard. And indeed, some looters aren’t affiliated with the protests at all, and are taking advantage of the situation. Others are acting in response to media attention.


  Looting happens partly because of protests, and protests happen because of more systemic issues in society. To stop people from looting, we have to examine the root causes and create systemic change. In *The Atlantic*, one political science professor sums it up: 


  > “The best way to prevent looting is to provide individuals with a living wage, provide for their basic needs, treat them with human dignity, and facilitate a life that is about thriving.”\[1] 


  Kimberly Jones also explains this impassionately in [How Can We Win.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb9_qGOa9Go)

  首先，我们必须承认，任何时候，只要一大群愤怒的人自发聚集，财产损坏会很常见。在BLM抗议期间，一小部分抗议者实际上是在抢劫。但它的发生有很多原因。


  当和平抗议被令人沮丧地忽视时，破坏公物的行为就成为发声的另一种方式。这些行为是在有象征性意味的地点上发生的(例如，针对像Target的大公司、警察局、雕像等)。在美国，这些地点的破坏行为植根于财富不平等，代表了人们一种重新分配财富的愿望。


  抢劫的发生在一定程度上是因为抗议活动，而抗议活动的发生是因为社会中更多的系统性问题。这是一种在政治和经济上感到无能为力的反应。为了阻止人们抢掠，我们必须查找根本原因，并创造系统性的变化。在《大西洋月刊》上，一位政治学教授总结道：“防止抢劫的最好方法是为个人提供基本生活工资，满足他们的基本需求，以人应有的尊严对待他们，促成一条有通向富足的生活途径。”\[1] 金伯利·琼斯(Kimberly Jones)在[《我们如何才能获胜》](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sb9_qGOa9Go)一书中满怀激情地解释了这一点。

  the need to acquire possessions through looting?
