title: I think looting is wrong.

  First, we have to acknowledge that any time large groups of angry people
  gather spontaneously, property damage is common. During the BLM protests, a
  small percentage of those protesting are actually looting. But there are many
  reasons that it happens.


  In protest, acts of vandalism happen on symbolic grounds (e.g. large corporations like Target, police stations, statues). In the U.S., these acts represent a desire for a redistribution of property—it’s a form of empowerment. These looters realize that large corporations have insurance and feel the effects of looting far less than the community. It has been a way make one’s voice heard when peaceful protests go frustratingly unheard. And, some looters just aren’t affiliated with the protests at all, and are taking advantage of the situation. Others are acting in response to media attention.


  Looting happens partly because of protests, and protests happen because of more systemic issues in society. To stop people from looting, we have to examine the root causes and create systemic change.
