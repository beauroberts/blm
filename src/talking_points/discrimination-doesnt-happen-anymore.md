title: Discrimination doesn't happen anymore.
title_zh: "[]"
rebuttal: >-
  Even if you have not seen or experienced discrimination, or do not believe you
  have acted in a discriminatory way towards others, it is happening at a
  systemic level across the country. Discrimination isn't *always* an overt act
  of aggression (like police violence), or defined by the law. It is also
  entrenched in much more prevalent, commonplace facets of society. For example:


  * Rather than open segregation laws that divided neighborhoods and businesses by color, now it's more difficult for POC to get the same mortgage loans as white people.

  * Rather than slave labor, we maintain massive wage gaps among different ethnicities.

  * Rather than not allowing promotions for POC, a hostile work environment and lack of diversity in leadership lead to fewer opportunities at work, which leads to higher rates of turnover.
