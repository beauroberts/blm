title: Discrimination doesn't happen anymore.
title_zh: 歧视不再发生。
rebuttal: >-
  Even if you have not seen or experienced discrimination, or do not believe you
  have acted in a discriminatory way towards others, it is happening at a
  systemic level across the country. Discrimination isn't always an overt act of
  aggression (like police violence), or defined by the law. It is also
  entrenched in much more prevalent, commonplace facets of society. For example:


  • In the past, open segregation laws that divided neighborhoods and businesses by color. Now, it's more difficult for people of color to get the same mortgage loans as white people.


  • In the past, America relied on slave labor. Now, there are massive, uncorrected wage gaps among different ethnicities.


  • In the past, people of color were not allowed to be promoted or even work certain jobs. Now, a hostile work environment and lack of diversity in leadership leads to fewer opportunities at work and high turnover.


  Taken altogether, discrimination in education, work, public spaces, and health care continue to cause real, though less overt, harm and oppression in America today.

  即使你没有看到或经历过歧视，或者不相信你以歧视他人的方式行事，它还是正在全国范围内系统性地发生。歧视并不总是一种公开地咄咄逼人的行为（如警察暴力），或由法律界定的罪行。它也植根于社会更为普遍、司空见惯的方面。例如：


  •过去，开放隔离法将社区和企业按肤色划分。现在，有色人种更难获得与白人相同的抵押贷款。


  •过去，美国依靠奴隶劳动。现在，不同种族之间存在巨大、未经纠正的工资差距。


  •过去，有色人种不得晋升，甚至不允许从事某些工作。现在，恶劣的工作环境和领导层固化导致有色人种工作机会减少和更高的就业不稳定性。


  总的来说，教育、就业、公共领域和医疗保健方面的歧视继续在今天的美国造成真正的伤害和压迫，尽管不那么明目张胆。

  Consider [this
  exercise](https://nationalseedproject.org/Key-SEED-Texts/white-privilege-unpacking-the-invisible-knapsack)
  from "The Invisible Knapsack" by Peggy McIntosh. What are ways in which you've
  had unearned disadvantages in your life? What about unearned advantages?


  How do you feel when you consider the experiences of unearned advantage and disadvantages of others?

  考虑做一下佩吉·麦金托什(Peggy
  McIntosh)的[“看不见的背包”中的这个练习](https://nationalseedproject.org/Key-SEED-Texts/white-privilege-unpacking-the-invisible-knapsack)。你在生活中有什么你无法左右的劣势？还有什么坐享其成的优势呢？


  当你考虑别人无法左右的劣势和坐享其成的优势时，你会有什么感觉？
