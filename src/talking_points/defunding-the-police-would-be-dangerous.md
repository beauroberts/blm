title: Defunding the police would be dangerous.

  There’s a lot of misunderstanding and fear around the phrase “defund the
  police.” But it’s not as straightforward as getting rid of the police force,
  and there are many potential solutions under this umbrella. 




  On one end of the spectrum, people are asking government officials to carefully look at the police budget and reinvest some of that money to other community groups or agencies. For example, rather than having cops respond to mental health crises, those funds could be redirected to organizations that are more equipped to provide social services and de-escalation. 




  On the other end, some people do want to dismantle the current police force. For them, the policing system is inherently unequal, and trust is damaged beyond repair. This doesn’t mean that there will be no emergency services—just that a new system of response will be built with the community in mind. [Here is an example](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/08/872416644/former-chief-of-reformed-camden-n-j-force-police-need-consent-of-the-people) of how Camden, NJ did this successfully in 2013.
