title: Defunding the police would be dangerous.

  There’s a lot of misunderstanding and fear around the phrase “defund the
  police.” But it’s not as straightforward as getting rid of the police
  force—there are many suggested ideas. 


  On one end of the spectrum, people are asking government officials to carefully look at the police budget and reinvest some of that money to other community groups or agencies. Currently, only a very small part of policing involves preventing crime that is actively in progress, or requires the use of force. Much of the day-to-day work involves standing in for other specialties: therapists, social workers, and mental health professionals. Defunding the police would mean shifting those resources to professionals who have appropriate training and are better equipped to de-escalate certain situations.


  On the other end, some people do want to dismantle the current police force. For them, the policing system is inherently unequal, and trust is damaged beyond repair. They want to start over and build up a new system from the ground up. This doesn’t mean that there would be no emergency services—just that a new system of response will be built with the community in mind. [Here is an example](https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-protests-for-racial-justice/2020/06/08/872416644/former-chief-of-reformed-camden-n-j-force-police-need-consent-of-the-people) of how Camden, NJ did this successfully in 2013.


  ## Ask Yourself


  * Does the person we send to catch a robber also need to be the person we send to interview a rape victim or document a fender bender? Should one profession be expected to do all that important community care (with very little training) all at the same time?

  * What reforms would you ask for?
