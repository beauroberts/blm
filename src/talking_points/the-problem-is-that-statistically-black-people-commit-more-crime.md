  Statistics about crime rates don't tell the whole picture, because they are
  based on arrests and convictions. Discrimination in policing and the justice
  systems means that people in Black communities are more likely to be arrested
  and convicted—over-representing the reported crime rate.


  Studies show: from police stops/searches (larger police presence) to bail decisions (worse terms for bail) to sentencing (harsher sentences), people in Black or gentrifying neighborhoods are policed more heavily. When you go looking for more crime, more crime is found—often low-level, non-violent misdemeanors.


  The crime rate may also be explained by other related socioeconomic factors, like poverty, public education, segregation laws, and environmental quality. A higher crime rate only highlights the systemic and pervasive nature of the discrimination.

  关于犯罪率的统计数据不能说明问题的全部情况，因为它们只是基于逮捕和定罪确定的。治安和司法系统方面的歧视意味着黑人社区的人们更有可能被逮捕和定罪，这超出了所报告犯罪率的范畴。


  研究表明：从警察的停车/搜查（会采用更多的警力）到保释决定（保释条件更糟）到判刑（判刑更严厉），黑人或底层社区的人们受到的警力对待更加严厉。如果你去了解更多的犯罪详情，更多的犯罪案例，你会发现这些往往是低程度的、非暴力的轻罪。


  犯罪率也可以由其他相关的社会经济因素，如贫困、公共教育、隔离法和环境质量来解释。较高的犯罪率只是更突出了歧视的系统性和普遍性。

ask_yourself: Have you ever stood in front of a shop for a few minutes, driven a
  few miles over the speed limit, or jaywalked? Imagine if a police officer was
  there to ticket you for every infraction.
ask_yourself_zh: 你曾经在商店前站了几分钟，开车超过限速几英里，或者游走在街巷吗？试想一下，如果一个警察在那里针对你的每一个轻微的违规行为都开出罚单。
