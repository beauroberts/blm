title: The problem is that statistically, Black people commit more crime.

  These numbers don't show the whole picture. Though Black people make up ~13%
  of the population, they are overrepresented in the criminal justice system.
  Studies show that racial discrimination is prevalent in many different aspects
  of the justice system, from police stops/searches (larger police presence in
  Black or gentrifying neighborhoods) to bail decisions (worse terms for bail)
  to sentencing (harsher sentences). This means that Black people are
  disproportionately policed and, as a result, disproportionately found guilty
  of crimes.


  The crime rate may also be explained by other related socioeconomic factors, like poverty, public education, segregation laws, and environmental quality. A higher crime rate only highlights the systemic and pervasive nature of the discrimination.
