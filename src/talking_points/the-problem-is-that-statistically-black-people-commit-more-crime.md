title: The problem is that statistically, Black people commit more crime.

  Statistics about crime rates don't tell the whole picture, because they are
  based on arrests and convictions. Discrimination in policing and the justice
  systems means that people in black communities are more likely to be arrested
  and convicted—over-representing the reported crime rate.


  Studies show: from police stops/searches (larger police presence) to bail decisions (worse terms for bail) to sentencing (harsher sentences), people in Black or gentrifying neighborhoods are policed more heavily. When you go looking for more crime, more crime is found—often low-level, non-violent misdemeanors.


  The crime rate may also be explained by other related socioeconomic factors, like poverty, public education, segregation laws, and environmental quality. A higher crime rate only highlights the systemic and pervasive nature of the discrimination.
