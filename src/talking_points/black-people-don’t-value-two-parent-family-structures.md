title: Black people don’t value two-parent family structures.
title_zh: 黑人不重视双亲家庭结构。
rebuttal: >-
  Disparaging sentiments about the Black family structure can be traced back to
  the controversial 1965 [Moynihan
  Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negro_Family:_The_Case_For_National_Action).
  This report, written for President Johnson as part of the War on Poverty,
  claimed that the rise of the Black single mother family structure was the
  cause of the economic disparity between black and white children.


  Among its flaws, the report overlooks the role of the Black extended family, a support system to cope with poverty and single parenthood. “Many theorists have argued that Moynihan got it backwards: The disadvantaged position of blacks is not the consequence of single-parent families, but rather the cause of them.” \[1]


  By condemning the family structure (i.e., focusing the blame on cultural patterns), the government absolves itself of responsibility to provide other solutions, like parental/child support, education equality, and alternatives to incarceration.


  Additionally, there’s a myth that Black families stay unmarried in order to take advantage of the welfare system. But:


  1. They can’t do that anyway ([read more](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/how-welfare-reform-left-single-moms-behind/361964/) about the TANF program)—and in fact, single mothers cannot even use welfare if they want to dedicate time to furthering their education.


  2. Consider this thought from California State Senator Holly Mitchell: “I don’t know a woman — and I don’t think she exists — who would have a baby for the sole purpose of having another $130 a month.”\[2]

  对黑人家庭结构的贬低感可以追溯到有争议的1965年[莫伊尼汉报告](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Negro_Family:_The_Case_For_National_Action)。作为反贫困战争的一部分，这份为约翰逊总统撰写的报告声称，黑人单亲母亲家庭结构的上升是造成黑人和白人儿童经济差距的原因。


  这份报告的缺陷是忽视了黑人大家庭的作用，这是一个支持贫困和单亲关系的系统。许多理论家认为莫伊尼汉因果倒置了：黑人的不利地位不是单亲家庭的结果，而是单亲家庭的原因。\[1]


  通过谴责家庭结构（即将责任归咎于文化模式），政府免除了自己提供其他解决方案的责任，如父母/子女支持、教育平等和提供关押监禁的替代方案。


  此外，还有一个传言说，黑人家庭为了利用福利制度而保持未婚状态。但是：


  1.她们无论如何都做不到这一点([阅读更多](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2014/05/how-welfare-reform-left-single-moms-behind/361964/)关于TANF计划的内容) - 事实上，如果单身母亲想把时间花在自身的进一步教育上，她们甚至一点福利都享受不到。


  2.请参考加利福尼亚州参议员霍莉·米切尔(Holly Mitchell)的话：“我不认识一个这样的女人 - 我也不认为她存在 - 她会为了每月多拿130美元而生孩子。”\[2]
