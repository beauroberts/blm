title: Asians are a successful minority. Why aren’t Black people?

  Believing that Asians owe their wealth and success to being more hardworking
  and responsible than Black people perpetuates the “model minority” myth. This
  myth exemplifies Asian Americans as a polite, deferential group who have
  achieved success through their own industriousness.


  There are several issues with the “model minority” myth:


  • Asian Americans only began to enjoy increasing social capital after WWII, when it became politically convenient to pit Asians against other minorities. In other words, Asians became more successful when the American government strategically allowed them to be. In practical terms, this meant experiencing less housing discrimination and police targeting, and more access to loans and quality education—while the government continued to maintain policies of segregation and discrimination against Black people.


  • This myth allows Asian Americans to predicate their success on their own merit, while ignoring the fact that strategic policies allowed them to be successful. White and Asian Americans can be complicit and downplay the role that systemic racism plays in other minorities’ struggles.


  • This myth paints all Asian Americans as a homogenous group, despite wide cultural differences between East Asians, Indians, and South Asians. Specifically, it focuses on successful East Asian and Indian immigrants who are often prioritized into the country based on their already-accredited educational backgrounds.


  We will always want to attribute our personal success to our own hard work. Fewer of us are willing to consider that other groups of people can work as hard, but face more structural barriers to success. It’s important to recognize that even if you benefit from the model minority myth, you may be contributing to racial injustice.

  认为亚洲人的财富和成功应归功于他们比黑人更勤奋和负责任的观点延续了“模范少数族裔”的神话。这个神话例证了亚裔美国人是一个彬彬有礼、谦恭的群体，他们通过自己的勤奋取得了成功。


  "模范少数族裔" 神话有几个问题：


  • 亚裔美国人直到二战后才开始享受不断增加的社会资本，让亚洲人与其他少数族裔抗衡在政治层面变得有利。换句话说，当美国政府在战略上允许亚洲人这样做时，他们才会变得更成功。实际上，这意味着减少住房歧视和警察执法目标针对性，获得更多贷款和优质教育的机会，而政府却继续维持对黑人的隔离和歧视政策。


  • 这个神话让亚裔美国人可以根据自己的努力来预测自己的成功，而忽略了一个事实，即战略政策让他们取得了成功。白人和亚裔美国人可能是同谋，并淡化了系统性种族主义在其他少数族裔斗争中所起的作用。


  • 尽管东亚人、印度人和南亚人之间文化差异很大，但这个神话将所有亚裔美国人描绘成一个同质的群体。具体来说，它侧重于成功的东亚和印度移民，他们往往根据已经获得认可的教育背景被优先考虑进入美国。


  我们永远希望将个人的成功归功于我们自己的辛勤工作。我们中很少有人会考虑其他群体也努力工作，但面临更多的结构性成功障碍。重要的是要认识到，即使你受益于模范的少数族裔神话，你也可能助长种族不公正。
