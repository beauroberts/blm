  Protests are sustained disruptions that are designed to inflict change in the
  existing system. When peaceful protests (for example, Colin Kaepernick's
  kneeling protests during the NFL games) do not enact change, people feel
  repeatedly ignored and create more powerful demonstrations. “I would never
  condone violence, ever,” says Elijah Norris-Holliday, a 24-year-old activist
  in the Twin Cities who has been organizing peaceful daytime protests and who
  was so distraught after seeing the video of Floyd’s death that he didn’t sleep
  for days. “But sometimes, when people feel like their voices are being ignored
  over and over and over, violence is the only other answer. They have to burn
  their own community down to get people to listen to them. We’re at a breaking
  point.” \[1]Additionally, some peaceful protesters have been provoked and are
  met with violence. Police in riot gear are using tear gas, rubber bullets, and
  other non-lethal tactics to intentionally incite chaos. Counter-protesters
  also appear at peaceful protests, armed, for similar reasons.Finally, consider
  the longer arc of history. Many freedoms have been won in America through
  violent revolutions (e.g. American Revolution, Civil War). "Many people are
  asking if violence is a valid means of producing social change. The hard and
  historical answer is yes. Riots have a way of magnifying not merely the flaws
  in the system, but also the strength of those in power."\[2]
