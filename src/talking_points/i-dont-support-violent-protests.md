  Protests are sustained disruptions that are designed to create change in the
  current system. When peaceful protests (for example, Colin Kaepernick's
  kneeling protests during the NFL games) do not create change, people feel
  repeatedly ignored and escalate their demonstrations.


  “I would never condone violence, ever,” says Elijah Norris-Holliday, a 24-year-old activist in the Twin Cities who has been organizing peaceful daytime protests and who was so distraught after seeing the video of Floyd’s death that he didn’t sleep for days. “But sometimes, when people feel like their voices are being ignored over and over and over, violence is the only other answer.” \[1]


  Some peaceful protesters have been provoked, or subject to violence from the police. Police in riot gear are using tear gas, rubber bullets, and other tactics to intentionally incite chaos. Counter-protesters also appear at peaceful protests, armed, for similar reasons.


  Finally, consider the longer arc of history. Many freedoms have been won in America through violent revolutions (e.g. American Revolution, Civil War). "Many people are asking if violence is a valid means of producing social change. The hard and historical answer is yes."\[2] Consider that the best way to keep protests from turning violent is to listen to peaceful protests and seriously consider making changes to address the issues being raised.

  抗议活动是一种持续的破坏活动，旨在改变当前的制度。当和平抗议(例如，科林·凯珀尼克(Colin
  Kaepernick)在NFL比赛期间跪下抗议)没有带来改变时，人们会反复感到被忽视，并升级他们的示威活动。


  “我永远不会容忍暴力，”双子城24岁的社会活动人士伊莱贾·诺里斯-霍利迪(Elijah Norris-Holliday)说。他一直在组织和平的日间抗议活动，在看到弗洛伊德死亡的视频后，他心烦意乱，好几天没有睡觉。“但有时，当人们感觉自己的声音一次又一次地被忽视时，暴力会成为唯一的另一个答案。”\[1]\

  一些和平示威者遭到挑衅，或受到警方的暴力攻击。身穿防暴装备的警察使用催泪瓦斯、橡皮子弹和其他战术故意煽动混乱。出于类似的原因，反抗议者也会出现在和平抗议活动中，并手持武器。\

  最后，考虑一下更长的历史弧线。美国通过暴力革命(如美国革命、内战)赢得了许多自由。“很多人都在问，暴力是否是产生社会变革的有效手段。历史给出了肯定的硬核答案。” \[2] 阻止抗议转为暴力的最佳方法是聆听和平抗议，并认真考虑进行改变以解决所提出的问题。
