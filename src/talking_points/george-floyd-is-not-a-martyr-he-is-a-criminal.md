rebuttal: Whatever his past, it doesn’t take away Floyd’s right to a fair trial.
  He doesn’t have to be a martyr for his death to be unacceptable and unjust. A
  criminal history should not matter when a cop is making an arrest—it does not
  justify excessive force or murder, especially when the person is already
  restrained. Floyd, or anyone's guilt or innocence should be determined by a
  jury of peers. And if guilty, his sentence should be determined by a judge, in
  accordance with the charges.
