title: George Floyd is a criminal, not a martyr.
title_zh: 乔治·弗洛伊德是罪犯，不是烈士。
rebuttal: This is beside the point. Whatever his past, it doesn’t take away
  Floyd’s right to a fair trial. He doesn’t have to be a martyr for his death to
  be unacceptable and unjust. A criminal history should not matter when a cop is
  making an arrest—it does not justify excessive force or murder, especially
  when the person is already restrained. Floyd, or anyone's guilt or innocence
  should be determined by a jury of peers. And if guilty, his sentence should be
  determined by a judge, in accordance with the charges.
rebuttal_zh: 这一点无关紧要。不管他的过去做了什么，这并不能夺走弗洛伊德获得公平审判的权利。他不必成为烈士，他的死是不可接受的和不公正的。当警察进行逮捕时，犯罪史并不重要，它不能成为过度使用武力或谋杀的理由，尤其是当此人已经受到人身限制时。弗洛伊德，或者任何人的有罪或无罪应该由陪审团来决定。如果有罪，他的刑期应该由法官根据指控确定。

  - How would this situation have been different if he was not a visible
  minority?

  - How does the media portray white people with criminal histories differently (e.g. Brock Turner, Dylann Roof)?

  如果他不是明显的少数族裔，情况会有什么不同？

  媒体如何以不同的方式描绘有犯罪史的白人（例如Brock Turner，Dylann Roof）？
