  America’s for-profit criminal justice system focuses on punishment, rather
  than rehabilitation. This leads to recidivism.


  Whatever his past, it doesn’t take away Floyd’s right to a fair trial. He doesn’t have to be a martyr for his death to be unacceptable and unjust. Since Jan. 1, 2015, 1,252 black people have been shot and killed by police, which does not even count those who died during arrest or in custody.
