title: I don’t understand why Black people have an advantage in college admissions.

  The U.S. has had a controversial history with affirmative action. The “action”
  in affirmative action means that we need to actively do something in order to
  include racial minorities. In college admissions, that means the colleges do
  their best to include underrepresented groups—they are not giving them
  preferential treatment.


  Like the idea of colorblindness (“I don’t see color”)—by ignoring our differences in color (or gender, or other protected classes), we are not really equalizing the playing field. Americans of color start from much further behind.


  ”But the reason we have affirmative action is that we once had slavery and Jim Crow and redlining and racial covenants, and that we once had all-white police forces and all-white union locals and all-white college campuses and all-white law firms. To paraphrase George Shultz, Nixon’s Secretary of Labor: for hundreds of years, the United States had a racial quota. It was zero. Affirmative action is an attempt to redress an injustice done to black people.”

  If other ethnic or racial minorities are discriminated against or lose, what do I have to gain?
