title: Black people shouldn't get an advantage in college admissions.

  The “action” in affirmative action means that we need to actively do something
  to include racial minorities. In college admissions, that means the colleges
  do their best to include underrepresented groups—this is not the same as
  giving them preferential treatment.



  Like the idea of colorblindness (“I don’t see color”), by ignoring our differences in race (or gender, or other protected classes), we are not really equalizing the playing field. It’s possible to treat people equally but still unfairly, because people of color start from much further behind. In any case, data shows that "White students still make up almost three-quarters of all private external scholarship recipients...White students are more likely than black, Latino, and Asian students to receive scholarships." \[1]



  ”But the reason we have affirmative action is that we once had slavery and Jim Crow and redlining and racial covenants, and that we once had all-white police forces and all-white union locals and all-white college campuses and all-white law firms. To paraphrase George Shultz, Nixon’s Secretary of Labor: for hundreds of years, the United States had a racial quota. It was zero. Affirmative action is an attempt to redress an injustice done to black people.” \[2]



  We won’t need affirmative action when early educational, social, and economic systems are truly unbiased. But until we do, we need affirmative action in order to shrink the gap between minority and white students.

  Do you feel that affirmative action has taken opportunities away from you? What kind of support did you receive prior to that moment?
