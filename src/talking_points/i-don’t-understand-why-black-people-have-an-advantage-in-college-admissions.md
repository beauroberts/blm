title: I don’t understand why Black people have an advantage in college admissions.

  The U.S. has had a controversial history with affirmative action. The “action”
  in affirmative action means that we need to actively do something in order to
  include racial minorities. In college admissions, that means the colleges do
  their best to include underrepresented groups—they are not giving them
  preferential treatment.


  Like the idea of colorblindness (“I don’t see color”)—by ignoring our differences in color (or gender, or other protected classes), we are not really equalizing the playing field. Americans of color start from much further behind. This is also reverse racism—which is not supported by data. "White students still make up almost three-quarters of all private external scholarship recipients in four-year bachelor’s programs, almost two-thirds of all institutional grants and scholarship recipients, and over three-quarters of all merit-based grants and scholarships, although white people only make up about 62 percent of the college student population and about half of all people under 19. White students are more likely than black, Latino, and Asian students to receive scholarships."


  ”But the reason we have affirmative action is that we once had slavery and Jim Crow and redlining and racial covenants, and that we once had all-white police forces and all-white union locals and all-white college campuses and all-white law firms. To paraphrase George Shultz, Nixon’s Secretary of Labor: for hundreds of years, the United States had a racial quota. It was zero. Affirmative action is an attempt to redress an injustice done to black people.”
