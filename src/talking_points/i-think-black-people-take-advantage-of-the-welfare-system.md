  Broadly speaking, the myth that welfare makes people lazy is perpetuated
  without evidence. From The Atlantic: “a 2015 meta-study of cash programs in
  poor countries found ‘no systematic evidence that cash transfer programs
  discourage work’ in seven different countries.”\[1] 


  In particular, the myth of the “welfare queen” (a stigma often directed at Black, single mothers) came from Ronald Reagan’s 1976 presidential campaign. Reagan was looking for a sensational story to advance his political campaign, which sought to reform U.S. social programs. He found it in Linda Taylor, an interracial woman who had a complicated upbringing and committed welfare fraud, along with a host of more serious crimes. Though her name was never used, “the woman from Chicago” stood for the idea that black people are too lazy to work, and incited outrage from the public—and the term stuck.


  Here’s an alternative perspective: instead of trying to police and catch the “freeloaders,” the U.S. can focus on providing poor families more reliable financial assistance, education, housing, and work training so that they can, in turn, focus on more long-term investments for their family. These are the types of investments that will see long-term benefits for an entire community.

  从广义上讲，福利使人懒惰的观点虽然没有证据支持，但是却根深蒂固。《大西洋报》报道："研究发现，2015年对贫穷国家现金援助计划中，没有证据表明现金转移计划使受到援助的七个国家的人民工作热情减少"。\[1]


  特别是，"福利女王"的[编造故事](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_queen)（一种经常针对黑人单身母亲的耻辱）杜撰自罗纳德·里根1976年的总统竞选。里根当时正在寻找一个耸人听闻的故事来推进他的政治竞选，他的团队试图改革美国的社会福利。他在琳达·泰勒（LindaTaylor）身上发现了可以利用的契机，她成长背景复杂，犯有福利欺诈罪，并犯下许多更严重的罪行。虽然她的名字从未被使用过，但"来自芝加哥的女人"这个短语传达了一种对黑人的偏见，言外之意是黑人懒得工作，这句话最终激起了公众的愤怒——这个短语被停用了。\

  这里有另一种观点：美国可以专注于为贫困家庭提供更可靠的经济援助、教育、住房保障和工作培训，这样他们就可以反过来专注于为他们的家庭进行更长期的投资，而不是时刻监管和抓获“搭便车不劳而获的人”。这些类型的投资将为整个社区带来长期利益。

ask_yourself: Welfare comes in many forms. What do you think of when you imagine
  what a welfare program provides? How might you or your family members have
  benefited from welfare programs?
