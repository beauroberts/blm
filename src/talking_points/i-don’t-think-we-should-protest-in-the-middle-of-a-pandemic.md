  Unfortunately, protesting is one of the few rights available to people to
  challenge systemic injustices and be heard. Many protesters are aware of the
  risk that they are putting themselves and others in, and are generally taking
  precautions to lower the risks.


  Protesters are weighing the pandemic and racism both as threats to public health—because both threaten our citizens’ quality of life. For them, the dangers of white supremacy outweigh the dangers of Covid-19. In fact, hundreds of public health and disease experts signed an open letter stating that the protests are justified, because “white supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to Covid-19.” They called the protests “vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of black people in the United States.”\[1] Vidal Guzman, 29, a protester in New York, said: “People are more scared of the police than Covid-19. They are willing to do anything.”\[2]


  There are guidelines to lower the risk of infection, and some cities have announced free COVID-19 tests for protesters. There are also ways to protest more safely—for example, attending small, local protests, where participants can more easily spread themselves out. 


  Finally, recent data from many U.S. cities show that the protests have not led to an obvious increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.

  不幸的是，抗议是人们挑战系统性不公正并被倾听的为数不多的权利之一。许多抗议者意识到他们把自己和其他人置于其中的风险，并普遍采取预防措施来降低风险。


  抗议者正在权衡同样作为公共健康威胁的流行病和种族主义 - 因为两者都威胁到我们公民的生活质量。对他们来说，白人至上的危险大于新冠肺炎的危险。事实上，数以百计的公共卫生和疾病专家签署了一封公开信，声明抗议是合理的，因为“白人至上是一个致命的公共卫生问题，早在新冠肺炎之前就有了，并助长了新冠肺炎。”他们称抗议活动“对国家公共健康至关重要，对受到威胁的美国黑人的健康尤为重要”。\[1]29岁的Vidal Guzman是纽约的一名抗议者，他说：“比起新冠肺炎，大家更怕警察。他们愿意做任何事。”\[2]


  这里已经有降低感染风险的指导方针，一些城市已经宣布为抗议者提供免费的新冠肺炎检测。也有更安全的抗议方式 - 例如，参加当地的小型抗议活动，参与者可以更容易地分散开来。


  最后，来自美国多个城市的最新数据显示，抗议活动并未导致新冠肺炎病例明显增加。

ask_yourself: Consider how the urgency of the protests might change if you and
  your family, or your race, were the targets of police brutality and violence
  in this country.
ask_yourself_zh: 想一想，如果你和你的家人或你的种族成为这个国家警察暴行和暴力的目标，抗议的紧迫性对你来说可能会发生什么变化。
