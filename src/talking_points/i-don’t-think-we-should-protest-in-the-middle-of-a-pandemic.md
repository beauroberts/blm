title: I don’t think we should protest in the middle of a pandemic.

  Unfortunately, protesting is one of the few rights available to people to
  challenge systematic injustices and be heard. Many protesters are aware of the
  risk that they are putting themselves and others in, but protesting inherently
  involves gathering densely in large numbers. There are guidelines to lower the
  risk, and some cities have announced free COVID-19 tests for protesters.


  Protesters are weighing the pandemic and racism both as threats to public health—because both threaten our quality of life. And for them, the dangers of white supremacy outweigh the dangers of Covid-19. In fact, hundreds of public health and disease experts signed an open letter stating that the protests are justified, because “white supremacy is a lethal public health issue that predates and contributes to Covid-19.” They called the protests “vital to the national public health and to the threatened health specifically of black people in the United States.”


  There are ways to protest powerfully but more safely—for example, attending small, local protests, where participants can more easily spread themselves out.


  Finally, data from many U.S. cities show that the protests have not led to an obvious increase in the number of COVID-19 cases.

  Consider how the urgency of the protests might change if you and your family were the targets of police brutality and violence.
