title: Black people don't value education.
title_zh: "[]"
rebuttal: >-
  Where does this belief come from? Many people, including teachers, have
  attributed the achievement gap between white students and black students to
  the value that their parents place on education. This belief ignores the more
  limited resources (financial and social) that Black families face. In the face
  of more pressing concerns (food, housing, and safety), education doesnâ€™t make
  the cut.


  In the long run, this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: racial bias against parents means they need to work longer hours and have limited resources to support their children; bias against Black children in school means less support from teachers; less support from both parents and teachers leads to fewer opportunities for children, who in turn can provide less opportunities to their own children, and so on.


  We need a system that provides meaningful educational opportunities and funding for all children in America. [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/what-we-do.html), [](https://inneractproject.org/about/)[Inneract Project](https://inneractproject.org/about/), and [Hip Hop Architecture](http://www.hiphoparchitecture.com/) are a few examples of community programs that show kids more diverse career paths forward.
