title: Black people don't value education.
title_zh: 黑人不重视教育
rebuttal: >-
  Where does this belief come from? Many people, including teachers, have
  attributed the achievement gap between white students and black students to
  the value that their parents place on education. This belief ignores the more
  limited resources (financial and social) that Black families face. In the face
  of more pressing concerns (food, housing, and safety), education doesn’t make
  the cut.


  In the long run, this becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy: racial bias against parents means they need to work longer hours and have limited resources to support their children; bias against Black children in school means less support from teachers; less support from both parents and teachers leads to fewer opportunities for children, who in turn can provide less opportunities to their own children, and so on.


  We need a system that provides meaningful educational opportunities and funding for all children in America. [Black Girls Code](https://www.blackgirlscode.com/what-we-do.html), [](https://inneractproject.org/about/)[Inneract Project](https://inneractproject.org/about/), and [Hip Hop Architecture](http://www.hiphoparchitecture.com/) are a few examples of community programs that show kids more diverse career paths forward.

  这种观点从何而来？许多人，包括教师，都把白人学生和黑人学生的成绩差距归因于他们的父母对教育的价值。这种信念忽视了黑人家庭面临更有限的（财力和社会）资源。他们会面对更紧迫的问题（食品、住房和安全），教育支出不得不削减。


  从长远来看，这成为一个自我实现的预言：对父母的种族偏见意味着他们需要工作更长时间，而且只有有限的资源来支持他们的孩子；在学校对黑人儿童的偏见意味着教师的对他们的教导减少；父母和教师的支持减少，导致儿童的机会减少，而儿童长大后能为自己的孩子提供的机会也相应减少，循环往复。


  我们需要一个系统，为美国所有儿童提供有意义的教育机会和资金。Black Girls Code, Inneract Project, 和Hip Hop Architecture是社区教育项目的例子，这些项目向孩子们展示了更多样化的职业发展道路。
