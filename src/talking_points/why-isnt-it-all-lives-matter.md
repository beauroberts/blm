title: Why isn't it All Lives Matter?
title_zh: "[]"
rebuttal: >-
  Of course all lives matter. Saying “Black Lives Matter” does not mean “*Only*
  Black Lives Matter.” The slogan is calling attention to the unfairness in a
  society that specifically discriminates against and endangers black people. 


  Consider an analogy: If a neighbor's house is on fire, you wouldn’t spray water on all the houses in the neighborhood and say, “but all houses matter.” You would work on saving the one house on fire, because the other houses don’t need the help in this specific moment.


  This moment and this movement is about Black lives. All lives don’t matter until Black lives matter.
